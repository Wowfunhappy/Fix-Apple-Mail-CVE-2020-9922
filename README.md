# Fix-Apple-Mail-CVE-2020-9922

Apple Mail has a scary zero-click vulnerability. Versions of OS X prior to High Sierra were not patched. https://mikko-kenttala.medium.com/zero-click-vulnerability-in-apples-macos-mail-59e0c14b106c

This SIMBL plugin works around the problem, by telling Apple Mail to not automatically expand zip files.


# Usage

First, install SIMBL, a framework for injecting code into Cocoa apps. Over the years, develoopers have created different versions of SIMBL for different versions of OS X: 

- OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard: https://github.com/msolo/simbl
- OS X 10.7–10.8: https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL
- OS X 10.9 Mavericks: https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/MacForgeFramework/releases
- OS X 10.10 – 10.12: https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL
- macOS 10.13+ https://github.com/MacEnhance/MacForge

For versions that don't include a UI, install plugins by copying them to /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/. Then, restart Apple Mail. You'll know that it's working if you can mail yourself a folder (drag a folder into the compose window) and it arrives as a zip file rather than a folder.

Please be aware that:
- I made this in 90 minutes and only tested it on 10.9. I don't see any reason for it to _not_ work on other releases, but that definitely does not mean that it will!
- On OS X 10.11+, System Integrity Protection needs to be turned off. The irony of needing to disable a security feature is not lost on me, and the choice is up to you, but SIP makes it impossible to modify Apple's code.

If you use this, feel free to open issues to tell me how it is or isn't working, as that's always cool to hear. However, I am unlikely to actually fix anything unless you're running OS X 10.9. Because OS X 10.9 is special! <3
