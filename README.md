# Fix-Apple-Mail-CVE-2020-9922

Apple Mail has a scary zero-click vulnerability. Versions of OS X prior to High Sierra were not patched. https://mikko-kenttala.medium.com/zero-click-vulnerability-in-apples-macos-mail-59e0c14b106c

This SIMBL plugin works around the problem, by telling Apple Mail to not automatically expand zip files.
